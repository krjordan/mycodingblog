I'm a full-time web developer living in Huntsville, AL. I started in web development a couple of years ago and I'm currently attending Athens State University. I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science with a minor in information systems management. Web development has given me the opportunity to solve real problems and meet a lot of interesting people. I find it an exciting field because it is challenging and keeps me on my toes, since it's constantly changing. When I'm not coding or doing massive amounts of homework, I can be found playing my PS4 or driving around in my WRX.

If you have a project that you need help with, I'd love to help out! You can message me on <a href="//twitter.com/ryanj1500">Twitter</a> or shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:ryjordan@gmail.com">RyJordan@Gmail.com</a>.
