                  I have decided to move my blog from Ghost to Hugo. I have enjoyed using Ghost, but I wanted to play around with some static site generators and host it with GitHub Pages. I have been using a Ghost, Docker and Digital Ocean setup and have enjoyed it, but it was time to break something.
Hugo After doing some research and playing around with a few different static site generators (Cryogen, GatsbyJS, Hexo and Phenomic, to name a few), I decided Hugo worked best for my needs.

                  <p>Recently, I was asked by a friend of mine how he would go about getting started in web development. So, I figured I would write a blog post on it and help him out, along with anyone else who might stumble across this.</p>

<p>I started out using <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a> and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Treehouse</a>. I read a ton of blog posts and fumbled my way through books reading about a lot of things I didn&rsquo;t understand. I also tried to complete every tutorial I came across. Finally, I found <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> which explains things in a more organized way and gives you a learning map, if you will.</p>

                  <p>I was recently tasked with building out an email newsletter. Honestly, I was dreading the task. Luckily, I did a bit of research before I started out on this adventure and found <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html">Foundation for Emails</a>. It&rsquo;s well documented and even has a <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/emails/docs/sass-guide.html">CLI</a>.</p>

<p>Getting started is as simple as <code class="language-none">npm install -g foundation cli</code> and then <code class="language-none">foundation new --framework emails</code>. Once complete, you are ready to start coding an email using Inky, Foundation&rsquo;s email templating language. Inky allows you to write <code>&lt;column&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;row&gt;</code> instead of writing out your emails in a table.</p>

If you&rsquo;re looking to go that route, I have written a quick tutorial on that <a href="http://mycodingblog.com/up-and-running-with-ghost-and-digital-ocean/">here</a>. I have not had any issues, but since I have been using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> more and more, I decided it was finally time to throw my blog into a container. I have to admit, it took a few days and a bit of research. Maybe I&rsquo;m still new at this whole coding thing, I know I have a ton to learn, but seriously?</p>

<p>I ran into a few hiccups, but I did finally find a solution. I am using the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/">Official Docker Ghost Image</a>. It briefly describes how to get it up and running. Well, almost&hellip; The commands given will end up giving you an error:</p>

                  <p>I decided to revisit a project I completed a while ago that displays a random quote from <a href="http://forismatic.com/en/">Forismatic</a>. This project is also part of the <a href="http://freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a> curriculum that I have been completing in my spare time. I originally used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to help with the layout of the page. I figured I would rewrite it without the help of a CSS framework to lean against, using flexbox. I have made a <a href="http://codepen.io/krjordan/full/oXRQXG/">codepen</a> for anyone who wants to look at the finished product.</p>

                  <p>I decided to continue with the small flexbox tutorials. So here is another one. In this tutorial, we will make a navigation header using flexbox. If you haven&rsquo;t read my first post on flexbox, you should check it out <a href="http://mycodingblog.com/discovering-flexbox/">here</a>. I have made a <a href="http://codepen.io/krjordan/pen/PPppOd/">codepen</a> of what we will be building. Let&rsquo;s get started with the HTML.</p>

                  <p>So, now that I work with a team of web developers, I am constantly learning new things. One of the many new things I&rsquo;ve learned about, is flexbox. I have to admit, I found it very intimidating at first. I figured I&rsquo;d make a small tutorial about flexbox using a very simple navigation menu.</p>

<p>Flexbox makes things easier, especially when it comes to centering items. One of the main reasons I use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> in the majority of my projects is due to it being a pain to layout items and get them centered. Using frameworks like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> help you get up and running quickly. However, most developers (I&rsquo;ve been guilty of this) don&rsquo;t go back and remove the unused CSS or use a CDN where most users will have the file cached, but for those who don&rsquo;t, well it could take a bit more time to load.</p>

                  <p>So I&rsquo;ve decided to start a blog and write about my journey of starting a new career. I just landed a job as a Junior Web Developer and I really wish I would have done this sooner! My goal for this blog is to gain a better understanding of the topics that I post about and hopefully help other new developers find their way through the maze of learning to code.</p>

<p>I have chosen to use <a href="https://ghost.org/">ghost</a> as my means to accomplish this. I wanted to play around with it before I decided to put it up on a server, so I started off with <a href="https://github.com/dbough/vagrant-ghost">this repo</a> on Github and typed <code>vagrant up</code> in my terminal. Assuming you have <a href="https://vagrantup.com">vangrant</a>, if not, check them out. It was actually quite simple once I figured out the best way to go about installing it. I&rsquo;m also looking forward to tweaking the default theme and maybe writing out a small tutorial on how I accomplished this.</p>

                  <p>I know there are numerous tutorials on how to setup Ghost with Digital Ocean, but I figured I&rsquo;d throw mine into the hat. This will be a quick and to the point tutorial of how to get your start a Ghost blog with Digital Ocean.</p>

<p>First, a quick introduction to <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>. Ghost is an open source blogging platform that is easy to get up and running. It functions like a CMS and your posts are written in Markdown. Digital Ocean is a cloud hosting provider. They offer good prices and have a good deal of tutorials to help you get up and running. I&rsquo;ll be honest, it took me a few days of research and playing around to get one of my sites up and running as I had only used GoDaddy before. So knowing your way around the terminal helps, but isn&rsquo;t required for this tutorial.</p>
